# Pytorch-Pediction
An interesting neural net for predicting linear equations.

## Application
- External libraries: matplotlib, pytorch.
- To refresh and view the next 'epoch' close the matplotlib window.
- The gradient/equation of the test data can be modified but results may vary.
- The number of epochs, weights, & bias can be changed to test different learning models.
